/**
 * Helpers for the axe-core accessibility scan suite (axe.spec.ts, issue #2099).
 *
 * A guard rail: each scan runs axe-core against a rendered surface and fails the
 * test on any violation under the WCAG 2.2 AA rule set. It complements the
 * behavioural checks in accessibility.spec.ts (keyboard paths, focus trapping,
 * landmarks) rather than replacing them: axe catches the static, machine-
 * detectable failures (contrast, names, roles, attributes) across whole
 * surfaces, while the behavioural suite covers what axe cannot observe.
 *
 * Adding a scan when a new surface lands: open the surface in a test, then call
 * `expectNoA11yViolations(page, locator)` scoped to it. See the documented
 * pattern in docs/guides/TESTING.md.
